* nwm - undefined window manager
[[./nwm.png]]

nwm is an extremely fast, small and simple dynamic window manager for X11.

** The fork of dwm
This beauty is based on [[https://dwm.suckless.org/][dwm]] - dynamic window manager by suckless devs.

I did a lot of patches and tweaks, a lot of refactoring and now it doesn't look similar enough to have the same name.

*** TODO Changes in my fork
It's been a while...

idk you'll figure out if you're smart enough.

*** Your code style sucks!!
no u

**** Use suckless-like code style
no cuz it sucks

**** Use tabs or at least 4/8/16/32/64/128 spaces
no.

I like 2 spaces indentation. I think everyone should prefer 2 spaces indentation. Tabs are bad. No argue.

Readability is not about indentation - it's about good code with empty lines, comments and consistent style.

*** I think your fork is bad because...
You can just fork it and make it "better"

Also you can try and PR your changes, but I don't usually agree with other people.

If forking it doesn't suit you - cry about it.

** Requirements
=Xlib= header files, =libxft-bgra= (or disable its support in ~config.mk~).

** Installation
Edit ~config.mk~ to match your local setup.

Edit ~config.h~ to configure some of the aspects of your build.

Enter the following command to build and install nwm:

#+begin_src sh
sudo make install
#+end_src

** Running nwm
Add the following line to your ~.xinitrc~ to start nwm using =startx=:

#+begin_src sh
exec nwm
#+end_src

In order to connect nwm to a specific display, make sure that
the =DISPLAY= environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

#+begin_src sh
DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec nwm
#+end_src

(This will start nwm on display =:1= of the host =foo.bar=.)

In order to display something in the bar, you should set your root window
name, e.g.:

#+begin_src sh
xsetroot -name "something"
#+end_src

You should use some script to make it dynamic. You can use [[https://github.com/NFrid/rootblocks][rootblocks]].

*** My "startnwm script"
=fehbg= is a script for wallpaper render, =autostart= is for starting programs
need to start excluding those that are already running.

#+begin_src sh
#!/bin/sh

while true; do
  fehbg &
  autostart &
  nwm 2> ~/.nwm.log
done
#+end_src
